The code is mainly designed to be simple and readable. It includes:
* `run_NSGA2_PSL.py`, `run_NSGA3_PSL.py` and `run_MOEAD_PSL.py` are main files to run the Enhanced PSL algorithm on the RE problem suite;
* `model.py` is a simple FC Pareto Set model definition;
* `problem.py` and `re_problem.py` contain all the test problems used in the paper;
* The folder `data` contains all the ground-truth Pareto Fronts used in the paper;
